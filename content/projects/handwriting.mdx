# Handwriting Generation

Generates uniquely styled PDFs with a minimal UI

- PDFs generated the right way (you can even mark/copy text after generation)
- Minimal UI
- Configurable with margin, font size, and spacing

A better version is made with TensorFlow V2 and Flask using RNN, but I can't deploy Docker/Flask with models for free and I am broke right now.

## Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)
- Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
