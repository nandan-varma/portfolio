# Hand writing generation

Generates uniquely generated pdf with minimal UI

- PDFs generated right way (you can even mark/copy text after generation)
- Minimal UI
- Configurable with margin, font size, spacings

A better version is made with Tensorflow V2 ,flask using RNN but cant deploy docker/ flask with models for free and i am broke rn.
