# Chain Reaction

A game with tactics and numbers.
I used to play this, but it became outdated and less responsive due to poor maintenance from its Android developer.
So, I recreated it on the web for cross-platform compatibility.

- Minimal UI with dark mode too
- 3 players too

## TODO
- Online multiplayer
- Configurable with margin, font size, spacings

## Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)
- Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
