## Bingo implements the following features

- Hashable board (so you can choose your favorite board every time).
- Multiplayer using peer to peer connection with WebRTC.

## TODO

- Use Firebase for matching players

## What I learnt

- Hashing
- Caching
- Peer-to-peer connections

P.S. I was not that good at web development when I did this.
