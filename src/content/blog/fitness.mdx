# Introduction

Just like all my other [projects](/projects), I like to combine my hobbies with my work.
I like to listen to music, so I made a [music app](/projects/music).
I like play chess, so I made a [chess app](/projects/chess).
\*cough\* I dont like to hand write my assignments, so I made a [handwriting app](/projects/handwriting) to write my assignments.
I like to work out, so I am making a fitness app.

## Why

I have used a lot of fitness apps in the past,
I have liked some features of some apps and disliked some features of other apps.
So as a developer, I thought to myself, why not build my own fitness app?
So I decided to build my own fitness app that focuses on the features I think are important.

## How

Lets start with the tech stack.
I am using React Native for the App because It is a cross platform framework
and allows me to use all the benifits of npm packages with great community support.
- [Expo](https://expo.dev) to routing and building the app.
- a sqlite database to store the data locally on the device for offline access and making it typesafe using [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/).
- [EAS](https://expo.dev/eas) to build and give over-the-air updates for both Android and iOS.
- [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev) for styling the app.
- [Expo SecureStore](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/securestore/) to securely store user data.
- All of this with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) for type safety and better developer experience.

## Final Thoughts

I am really excited to build this app and I hope you are too.
I will be updating this blog post with more features and updates as I go along.
I will also be posting updates on my [webpage](/) and [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nandanvarma/) page.
