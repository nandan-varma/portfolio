# Introduction

Just like all my other [projects](/projects), I like to combine my hobbies with my work.
I like to listen to music, so I made a [music app](/projects/music).
I like play chess, so I made a [chess app](/projects/chess).
\*cough\* I dont like to hand write my assignments, so I made a [handwritten pdf gen app](/projects/handwriting) to write my assignments.
I like to workout, so I am making a fitness app.

# Why

I have used a lot of fitness apps in the past,
I have liked some features of some apps and disliked some features of other apps.
So as a developer, I thought to myself, why not build my own fitness app?
So I decided to build my own fitness app that focuses on the features I think are important while being privacy focused and open source.

# Features

Let's talk about the features I want to implement in this app.

**Non-functional requirements:**
- Simple and intuitive UI
- Privacy focused
- Open source
- Cross platform
- Offline support
- Lightweight

**Functional requirements:**
- Display all exercises with important information with images and descriptions
- Track workouts and exercises
- Track progress over time
- Set goals and reminders
- Create custom workout plans
- Calendar view to see past workouts
- AI assistance for workout suggestions

# How
Now, Lets start with the tech stack I am using to build this app.
I am using React Native for the App because It is a cross platform framework
and allows me to use all the benifits of great TS/JS packages and community support.
- [Expo](https://expo.dev) to routing and building the app.
- a sqlite database to store the data locally on the device for offline access and making it typesafe using [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) for schema, querying and migrations.
- [EAS](https://expo.dev/eas) to build and give OTA(over-the-air) updates for both Android and iOS.
- [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev) for styling the app.
- [Expo SecureStore](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/securestore/) to securely store user data.
- [React Native Reusables](https://rnr-docs.vercel.app/) for reusable components and utilities.
- All of this with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) for type safety and better developer experience.

# Demo

Here is a quick demo of the app I have built so far.

*UI is subject to change as I am still working on it.

# Final Thoughts

I am really excited to build this app and I hope you are too.
I have been developing and writing this app on my weekend free time after college, so it is a slow process.
I will be writing follow up posts on the progress of this app and the features I am implementing.
I will also be posting updates on my [webpage](/) and [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nandanvarma/) page.
If you want to see code for this app, you can check out the [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/nandan-varma/replog).
