# Introduction

I just completed my internship at Highspot as a **Associate Engineer Intern**.
It was an incredible **start to my career** and I am grateful for the opportunity.
I want to take a moment to reflect on my experience and share some of the things I learned
during my time there.

# What I did

I dont know if I can say much about what I did. Just to be safe, I will keep it vague.

During my internship, I worked on mostly one feature which is just an idea before I started there.
I have seen it grow from **idea to prototype to an actual feature**.
I have mostly been working on the **Frontend, API and LLM side of things**.
If you know me, you know this is right up my alley.

Since This was my first internship, I was a bit nervous at first.
But the team was very welcoming and supportive.
I was able to contribute to the project and learn a lot along the way.
I also had the opportunity to work with some **amazing people**.
Everyone was very knowledgeable and willing to help.
I also had the chance to attend some meetings and see how magic happens behind the scenes.

# What I learned

I learned a lot during my internship.
Will try to list some of them here:
-  work in a team.
-  communicate effectively.
-  manage my time.
-  write clean and maintainable code.
-  use new tools and technologies.
-  debug and troubleshoot issues.
-  give and receive feedback.
-  be professional ... all the linkedin jargon.
-  work with LLMs in a production environment.
-  build a feature from scratch.
-  **most importantly, made some great friends and memories**.

# Thank you

I want to thank everyone at Highspot for making my internship such a great experience.
I am not going to name names but you know who you are.
I am grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow.
I am excited to see what the future holds.
And I hope you guys will be as awesome as you are now.
