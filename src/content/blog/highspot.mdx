# Introduction

I have been applying to all the interesting job listing I can find.
been doing that for a while, but I could not get any interviews.

But then I got an email from HighSpot, It contents were simple :
Here is a Github Repo with some tasks, complete it using **React and copilot** and make a PR and submit an hour recording of your thought process through this.

I was excited and a bit nervous. But then, something crazy happened—my laptop broke down right in the middle of my exams!
If you know me, You know I didn't give up either exams or the assignment.
I didn’t want to switch to another laptop because setting up git with github auth, node, and npm and other stuff is a pain and college issued laptops are restricted from installing these clis.

So, I ordered a new screen for my laptop and fixed it myself.

Just when I thought things were back to normal, my laptop crashed again—right in the middle of recording my solution! I had only 15 minutes left. I quickly restarted, kept recording, and finished the task.

I’m not telling this as an excuse. I just want to say: if you really want something, you’ll always find a way.
