# Webpage to show what I worked on and am working on.

Some things are better not reimplemented, so I copied some homework.
This is a fork from [chronark/chronark.com](https://github.com/chronark/chronark.com),
although highly modified to suit myself.

## Features

- Projects rendered from markdown
- Clean CSS
- dynamically generated metadata

## TODO

- Change Color schemes and design
- implement project system

## What I learnt

- DNS services
- SEO ( Search Engine Optimization )

## Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)
- Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
